Dev workflow tips:

== Running development server

Be sure you have a valid MongoDB running. You initiate a local database with 'mongodb'.
Ensure your configuration files are pointing to the correct path.

Run the following from the main root dir:

NODE_ENV=development node_modulesitter/bin/jitter src/coffee src/js src/js/app.js

As changes are made to the src/coffee directory, they are recompiled into src/js,
tests are run, and the node server restarted. This workflow is enabled by Jitter.

Note you'll need to map your /etc/hosts and test on local.host:3000, due to FB security
nonsense

== Lint
