Dev workflow tips:

== Running development server

Be sure you have a valid MongoDB running. You initiate a local database with 'mongodb'.
Ensure your configuration files are pointing to the correct path.

Run the following from the main root dir:

NODE_ENV=development PORT=3000 node_modules/jitter/bin/jitter -lt src/coffee src/js src/js/app.js

As changes are made to the src/coffee directory, they are linted and recompiled into
src/js, tests are run, and the node server restarted. This workflow is enabled by Jitter.

Heroku:

Heroku branch can be redeployed with:

git push heroku heroku:master

Heroku's MongoDB URL derives from a password that needs to be set here https://providers.mongohq.com/home for 'heroku' user. Specify one there and update the config/heroku.json file or you will not be able to add/edit entries
