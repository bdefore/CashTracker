Dev workflow tips:

== Facebook integration

Note the local.host:3000 nonsense, due to FB security localhost:3000 is not allowed

== Running development server

Be sure you have a valid MongoDB running. You initiate a local database with 'mongodb'.
Ensure your configuration files are pointing to the correct path.

== CoffeeScript, watching and redeploying per change

At the moment, there's a two terminal solution:

Terminal 1:
	From main dir, run: jitter src/coffee src/js test
Terminal 2:
	From main dir, run: NODE_ENV=development nodemon src/app.js local.host:3000
	Add the --debug switch to get node-monitor debugging

This will then compile CS down to JS per change and then nodemon will restart node.js

== Lint
