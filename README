Dev workflow tips:

== Facebook integration

Note the local.host:3000 nonsense, due to FB security localhost:3000 is not allowed

== CoffeeScript, watching and redeploying per change

At the moment, there's a two terminal solution:

Terminal 1:
	From main dir, run: jitter src/coffee src
Terminal 2:
	From main dir, run: nodemon src/app.js local.host:3000
	Add the --debug switch to get node-monitor debugging

This will then compile CS down to JS per change and then nodemon will restart node.js
